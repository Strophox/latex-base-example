Recall how under canonical circumstances ($\rightarrow$ cit. \cite{PM10}) equation \big(\ref{eq:conjecture}\big) is believed to be provable from the axioms.
\begin{equation}
	\tag{4.2.1.1}
	\label{eq:conjecture}
	1 + 1 \approx{} 2
\end{equation}
Based.\ on this and making use of some simple re-indexing we have the following trivial result

% Demonstrate list of descriptions with nice indents
\begin{description}[nosep,noitemsep,leftmargin=5mm]
	\item[Point-set topology.] Too many pathologies. Nowadays the only topologies for me are Grothendieck topologies.
	\item[Weights, in the context of Lie algebras.] The constructions are high\-ly non-ca\-no\-ni\-cal if not even arbitrary sometimes.
	\item[Elementary topoi.] Unless you're a logician, I can't see why you would prefer them to honest-to-Grothendieck sheaf topoi (feel free to change my mind).
	\item[Classical algebraic geometry à la Weil.] It was a mess (again, due to point-set topology being a pain), and not to mention very restrictive, as varieties only behave well over algebraically closed fields.
	\item[Topological vector spaces.] They are not ugly per se, but extremely delicate and subtle, and daing with them can sometimes involve hours if not days trying to find the right norm on a perfectly fine algebraic object (e.g. tensor products of Banach spaces).
	\item[Tate's rigid analytic varieties and Berkovich spaces.] They are practical and easy to visualise, but better to have a nice category with bad objects than a bad category of nice objects. One also needs to impose all sorts of extra finiteness conditions on them in order to be able to even begin computing their cohomologies. Luckily, these categories embed into the category of adic spaces (in the sense of Huber), which is much nicer, especially if you were to restrict down to the subcategory of perfectoid spaces.

// At this point, I'd like to take a moment to speak to you about the Adobe PSD
// format. PSD is not a good format. PSD is not even a bad format. Calling it
// such would be an insult to other bad formats, such as PCX or JPEG. No, PSD
// is an abysmal format. Having worked on this code for several weeks now, my
// hate for PSD has grown to a raging fire that burns with the fierce passion
// of a million suns.
//
// If there are two different ways of doing something, PSD will do both, in
// different places. It will then make up three more ways no sane human would
// think of, and do those too. PSD makes inconsistency an art form. Why, for
// instance, did it suddenly decide that *these* particular chunks should be
// aligned to four bytes, and that this alignement should *not* be included in
// the size? Other chunks in other places are either unaligned, or aligned with
// the alignment included in the size. Here, though, it is not included. Either
// one of these three behaviours would be fine. A sane format would pick one.
// PSD, of course, uses all three, and more.
//
// Trying to get data out of a PSD file is like trying to find something in the
// attic of your eccentric old uncle who died in a freak freshwater shark
// attack on his 58th birthday. That last detail may not be important for the
// purposes of the simile, but at this point I am spending a lot of time
// imagining amusing fates for the people responsible for this Rube Goldberg of
// a file format.
//
// Earlier, I tried to get a hold of the latest specs for the PSD file format.
// To do this, I had to apply to them for permission to apply to them to have
// them consider sending me this sacred tome. This would have involved faxing
// them a copy of some document or other, probably signed in blood. I can only
// imagine that they make this process so difficult because they are intensely
// ashamed of having created this abomination. I was naturally not gullible
// enough to go through with this procedure, but if I had done so, I would have
// printed out every single page of the spec, and set them all on fire. Were it
// within my power, I would gather every single copy of those specs, and launch
// them on a spaceship directly into the sun.
//
// PSD is not my favourite file format.\end{listing}
